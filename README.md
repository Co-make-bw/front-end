CO-MAKE
Front-end

Co-Make is a full-stack web application for citizens in the US to draw attention to local issues in their communities. Once users are registered and logged in, they can edit their profile, track US States to see issues local to those states, upvote issues to draw attention, and post new issues to the states they care about. All this functionality is performed as a seamless, single-page-application.
